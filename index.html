        </header>
            <p>I've owned a lot of video game consoles throughout my lifetime and they have helped to fuel my video game
                and gaming in general hobby. Let me take you on a brief journey through the consoles I've owned and how
                they've shaped me to be the gamer I am today.

            Like most of my generation I started off with the Nintendo Entertainment System. My sister had won one in
            a local contest. At the time I didn't understand how cool this was but I was very young. Maybe four or five
            at the time. I still remember holding the controller for the first time, learning to play Mario and Duckhunt
            with my dad.

            Growing a little older I moved into the Super Nintendo and that became my most nostalgic console. Not because
            it was my favorite console of all time, but I got it at a time in my life where I became more aware of video games
            and my skill level increased. Some of my favorite games of all time where on that console including &quot;Donkey Kong 2: 
            Diddy's Conquest&quot;

            As I got older more consoles continued to be released. I had more choices to what consoles I would get and we were 
            moving in the 3D Graphics age. Ultimatley me and my family ended up choosing to go with the Sony Playstation as our console of choice,
            though being the young gamer I was I wanted every console I could possibly get. The playstation with it's graphics and games were great,
            but my memories of the console weren't as fond as others. It did however have my favorite game of all time on it in "The Legend of Mana"
        </p>

            After the playstation consoles became a bit more rapid for me. My parents had me sell my first three consoles to trade
            up for a Playstation 2 and an Xbox. I got myself a gamecube as well completely skipping over the Nintendo 64 (even though
            it was on my Christmas List for a good three years), and all of those systems carried me through to the later years in my
            life helping to shape the person I am today.

            The first console I ended up buying myself was the Nintendo Wii. I bought it in high school with the first of my new found
            'working money' and it was an awesome experience. Although I didn't end up getting too many games for the system I took
            pride in knowing that I had purchased it myself. I ended up getting an Xbox 360 as well, but after those two consoles there was
            quite a gap in my console ownership until recent years.

            Until only recently I didn't have a newer video game console, I was relegated to my computer for all of my gaming needs. Which
            was great but there was always a part of me that wanted to hold a controller again in my hand. Recently I was financially able
            as an adult to not only finally upgrade to an Xbox One console, but I was able to get myself a Nintendo Switch as well, both
            of which have been incredibly fun and rewarding consoles.

            Video Games have helped shape me into the person I am today and they will always hold a special place in my heart. The consoles
            allow me to look back at periods in my life and relive them through the games that I was playing at the time and it is a great 
            thing.
